Comme cela peut √™tre qu'il y aura un armistice et que cesseront de mourir des jeunes gens qui n'ont aucune raison de se faire tuer. A t-on tant d'Europ√©ens que √ßa?Etait -il si difficile de faire un Etat f√©d√©ral?

This is actually part of the reason why Putin was emboldened to invade UA in 2022, thinking that yet again the west won't care and they can do what they want."
